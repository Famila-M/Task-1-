The computer looks up the destination host. If it exists in local DNS cache, it uses that information. 
Otherwise, DNS querying is performed until the IP address is found.

Then, your browser opens a TCP connection to the destination host and sends the request according to 
HTTP 1.1 (or might use HTTP 1.0, but normal browsers don't do it any more).

The server looks up the required resource (if it exists) and responds using HTTP protocol, sends the data to the client (=your browser)

The browser then uses HTML parser to re-create document structure which is later presented to you on screen. 
If it finds references to external resources, such as pictures, css files, javascript files, these are is delivered the same way as the HTML document itself.
