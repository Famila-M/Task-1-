HTTP 1.1 relies on the transport layer to avoid buffer overflow, each new TCP connection requires a separate flow control mechanism.
The contents of each stream are HTTP 1.1 requests and responses, just encoded and packed up differently. 
HTTP 2, however, multiplexes streams within a single TCP connection, and will have to implement flow control in a different manner.
HTTP2 adds a number of features to manage the streams, but leaves old semantics untouched.
